Mahi is a bachelor's  student in the [Department of Physics and
Nanotechnology](https://www.srmist.edu.in/department/department-of-physics-and-nanotechnology/) at
[SRM Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.srmist.edu.in/).

Mahi is fascinated by the power of computational physics to solve complex scientific problems
through advanced algorithms. With prior experience in Python and ongoing work in Fortran, at
MAVENs,  Mahi has studied the Monte Carlo Ising model, exploring the magnetization and energy
properties of two-dimensional ferromagnets across different temperatures.
