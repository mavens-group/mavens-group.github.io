<!-- With a career rooted in theoretical and computational physics, Dr. Banerjee brings a deep expertise in density functional theory (DFT) and a sharp focus on materials discovery for sustainability and quantum information science. His group routinely integrates electronic structure theory with data-driven approaches, pushing the frontiers of both fundamental understanding and application-oriented design. -->

<!-- As an academic mentor, Dr. Banerjee fosters a vibrant research environment that values rigor, curiosity, and collaboration. He actively mentors PhD and Master's students across interdisciplinary projects and is committed to building a platform that blends scientific excellence with translational impact. -->

<!-- He is also deeply involved in scientific outreach, curriculum development, and open-source dissemination of tools and tutorials to democratize access to computational materials science. -->

Dr Rudra Banerjee is an assistant professor of Physics at the [Department of Physics and
 Nanotechnology](https://www.srmist.edu.in/department/department-of-physics-and-nanotechnology/) at
 [SRMIST](https://www.srmist.edu.in). He is the group leader of the **M**aterials **A**dvancing a
 **V**iable **EN**ergy future (MAVENs) Group.

Dr. Banerjee boasts over a decade of experience in the field of 2D and disordered materials,
resulting in a rich and varied portfolio.  His research deals with computational material science,
specifically designing new materials for green-energy and qubits. Dr. Banerjee implements Monte
Carlo and _ab-initio_ DFT and KKR-CPA methods along with Machine Learning model to analyse and
predict the properties of materials numerically.  His collaborative spirit extends to leading
experimentalists, fostering a deep understanding of materials behaviour.

Dr. Banerjee's contributions extend beyond research. He takes core courses like classical mechanics
and computational physics regularly to BSc and MSc students and the computational methods to PhD
students. He is playing an instrumental role in developing multiple courses and curriculums at
SRMIST.

Dr. Banerjee is a life-time member of Indian Physics Association.
