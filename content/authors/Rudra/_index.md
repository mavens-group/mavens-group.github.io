Dr Rudra Banerjee is an Assistant Professor of Physics at the [Department of Physics and Nanotechnology](https://www.srmist.edu.in/department/department-of-physics-and-nanotechnology/) at [SRMIST, KTR Campus](https://www.srmist.edu.in). He is the group leader of the **M**aterials **A**dvancing a **V**iable **EN**ergy future (MAVENs) Group.

Dr Banerjee boasts over a decade of experience in the field of 2D and disordered materials, resulting in a rich and varied portfolio. His research focuses on computational materials science, specifically designing new materials for green energy and quantum applications. He employs Monte Carlo simulations, *ab initio* DFT, and KKR-CPA methods, alongside machine learning models, to analyse and predict the properties of materials from first principles. His collaborative spirit extends to leading experimentalists, fostering a deep understanding of material behaviour through joint efforts.

He actively mentors MSc and PhD students within the MAVENs group, nurturing the next generation of researchers in computational physics and materials design.

Dr Banerjeeâ€™s contributions extend beyond research. He regularly teaches core courses such as classical mechanics, mathematical physics, and computational physics to BSc and MSc students, as well as computational methods to PhD scholars. He also plays an instrumental role in developing new courses and curricula at SRMIST.

He is a lifetime member of the Indian Physics Association.
