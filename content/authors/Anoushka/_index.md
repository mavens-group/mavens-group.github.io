Anoushka is a bachelor's  student in the [Department of Physics and
Nanotechnology](https://www.srmist.edu.in/department/department-of-physics-and-nanotechnology/) at
[SRM Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.srmist.edu.in/).

At MAVENs, Anoushka's work focuses on simulating magnetic materials to uncover atomic-level
interactions, exploring phenomena such as spin dynamics and phase transitions.  Anoushka is
developing a Fortran code to simulate the Ising model, emphasizing its role in exploring magnetic
phase transitions and spin dynamics. Her work combines computational precision with theoretical
rigor, contributing to the understanding of fundamental interactions in magnetic materials and
complex systems.
