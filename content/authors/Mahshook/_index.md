Mohammed Mahshook is a Research Scholar in the MAVENs group at the [Department of Physics and Nanotechnology](https://www.srmist.edu.in/department/department-of-physics-and-nanotechnology/), [SRMIST, KTR](https://www.srmist.edu.in). His research applies machine learning techniques to understand structure–activity relationships in materials for quantum information processing.

He develops predictive models to identify candidate materials and analyze their structural and emergent properties. Mahshook focuses on materials capable of hosting deep-level centers — point defects that create isolated electronic states within the bandgap, essential for semiconductor-based quantum technologies including quantum computing, secure communication, and precision sensing.

He uses data-driven models to predict host–defect combinations that meet quantum compatibility requirements, working at the interface of data science and condensed matter physics.
