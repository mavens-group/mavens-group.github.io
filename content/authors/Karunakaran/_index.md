Dr Karunakaran M is the **first** PhD graduate of the MAVENs. He successfully defended his doctoral thesis in 2025, following a research programme focused on computational and theoretical materials science for energy- and spin-based applications.

His doctoral work employed *ab initio* density functional theory alongside advanced techniques such as the Korringa–Kohn–Rostoker coherent potential approximation (KKR–CPA), Monte Carlo simulations, and data-driven analysis to examine the effects of chemical disorder, alloying, and controlled doping on the electronic, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties of functional materials.

During his PhD, Dr Karunakaran made sustained contributions to the understanding of Heusler and related alloy systems, with particular emphasis on materials relevant to magnetocaloric refrigeration and spintronic technologies. His research demonstrated how compositional tuning under realistic disorder conditions can enhance Curie temperatures, stabilise magnetic phases, and improve functional performance. These findings were reported in peer-reviewed journals spanning applied physics, solid-state chemistry, and magnetism, reflecting a careful balance between fundamental insight and application-oriented materials design. As an alumnus of the MAVENs group, his work exemplifies the group’s interdisciplinary approach to computational materials research and establishes a strong foundation for future doctoral research within the group.
