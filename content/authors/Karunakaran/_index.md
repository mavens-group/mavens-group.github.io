Mr. Karunakaran M is a Research Scholar in the [Department of Physics and Nanotechnology](https://www.srmist.edu.in/department/department-of-physics-and-nanotechnology/) at [SRMIST, KTR](https://www.srmist.edu.in).

His research employs sophisticated computational methodologies, including _ab initio_ density
functional theory (DFT), the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker Coherent Potential Approximation (KKR-CPA), and
Monte Carlo simulations, to investigate the electronic, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties of
materials.

Karunakaran's scholarly interests are primarily centred on materials with potential applications in
green energy, such as magnetocaloric and spintronics properties of Heusler alloys. He is
particularly committed to advancing the understanding and control of material properties,
performance, and efficiency through the strategic use of doping. With over three and a half years
of research experience in Heusler alloys, his current work focuses on modulating the electronic and
magnetic properties of disordered Heusler alloys, thereby contributing to the development of
advanced materials for sustainable energy technologies.

Besides publishing his work in peer reviewed journals, Mr. Karunakaran also presents his work in
various national and international conferences.
