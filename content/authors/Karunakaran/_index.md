Karunakaran M is a Research Scholar in the MAVENs group at the [Department of Physics and Nanotechnology](https://www.srmist.edu.in/department/department-of-physics-and-nanotechnology/), [SRMIST, KTR](https://www.srmist.edu.in). His research integrates *ab initio* density functional theory (DFT), the Korringa–Kohn–Rostoker coherent potential approximation (KKR–CPA), and Monte Carlo simulations with machine learning approaches to analyse the electronic, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties of functional materials.

Karunakaran focuses on Heusler alloys for sustainable technologies, including magnetocaloric cooling and spintronic applications. He investigates how chemical disorder and strategic doping tune electronic and magnetic behaviour, contributing to advanced materials development for green-energy systems.

He publishes in peer-reviewed journals and presents at national and international conferences. Karunakaran mentors undergraduate students in scientific computation and communication.
