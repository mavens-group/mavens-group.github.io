Today, my MSc student, __Amrutha__ surprised me with a beautiful purse. She purchased it from her very
first earning from her summer project at [SINP](https://www.saha.ac.in/web/summer-home), Kolkata.

In academia, we measure success through publications and grants, but moments like these remind us
why we do what we do.

The first independent earning is a milestone every student cherishes. She chose to express her
gratitude with that. This represents the trust a student places in their teacher; the beautiful
bond between a teacher and a student. These moments make all the guidance and late nights class
note preparations worthwhile.

__To Amrutha__: Thank you for this incredible thoughtfulness. I'm so proud of the researcher and person
you've become. It's been wonderful watching your growth since your BSc days. Wishing you continued
success in all your endeavours.
