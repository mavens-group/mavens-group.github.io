Karunakaran’s work is a significant contribution to the field of computational magnetism, with a focused investigation on Heusler alloys. His research explored:

- Doping-induced enhancement of Curie temperature in Zn₂Ru₁₋ₓAₓMn Heusler systems
- Electronic structure and magnetic phase transitions in disordered alloys
- First-principles calculations combined with Monte Carlo simulations to estimate magnetic transition temperatures
- The role of chemical substitution in tuning magnetism for spintronic applications

His publications in Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials, Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids, and Applied Physics Letters reflect the depth and novelty of his work.

Karunakaran’s journey has laid the foundation for MAVENs' computational magnetism efforts, and we look forward to seeing his continued contributions to the field.

Congratulations, Karunakaran!
