> "Electronic and Magnetic Properties of Disordered Heusler Alloys"

Karunakaranâ€™s research has made substantial contributions to the field of computational magnetism,
with a strong focus on disordered Heusler alloys. His work systematically investigates the effect
of chemical disorder and elemental doping on the Curie temperature, magnetic phase transitions, and
electronic structure of these materials using first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo
simulations.

Some of his key outcomes include:

- Identification of doping strategies to enhance magnetic ordering
- Understanding the role of structural disorder on magnetic interactions
- Proposals for novel Heusler compositions for spintronic applications

Karunakaran has published his findings in reputed journals such as:

- Applied Physics Letters (2025)
- Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials (2023)
- Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids (2024)
- Journal of Solid State Chemistry (2024)


His work marks a significant milestone in MAVENs' vision of computationally driven discovery of
magnetic materials. We extend our heartfelt congratulations to Karunakaran on this achievement!
