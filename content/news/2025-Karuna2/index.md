I am absolutely thrilled and immensely proud to announce that my first PhD student, [Karunakaran M](../../author/dr-karunakaran-m) has successfully defended his doctoral thesis!

This is a really significant milestone and a true highlight for the Mavens group. Karunakarn’s research is genuinely interesting, focusing on the electronic, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties of Heusler alloys.

His work, integrating ab initio Density Functional Theory (DFT), the Korringa–Kohn–Rostoker
Coherent Potential Approximation (KKR–CPA), and Monte Carlo simulations with machine learning
approaches, has provided critical insights. He focused specifically on Heusler alloys for
sustainable technologies, including magnetocaloric cooling and spintronic applications,
demonstrating how chemical disorder and strategic doping can be used to tune material properties
for green-energy systems.

A massive congratulations, **Dr Karunakarn M**!

Your hard work, dedication, and rigorous approach to computational physics are truly commendable. We look forward to seeing your future contributions to the field.
