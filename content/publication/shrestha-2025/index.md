abstract: 'Hydrogen production via the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) is crucial for sustainable
energy, but its reliance on expensive Pt-based catalysts limits scalability. Here, we investigate
the catalytic performance of Zr-doped $Ti_3C_2$ and $Ti_3CN$ MXenes using first-principles density
functional theory (DFT). Our results show that Zr doping at 3% and 7% significantly enhances HER
activity by reducing the work function to the optimal range of 3.5–4.5 eV and achieving near-zero
Gibbs free energy ($\Delta G_H$
= 0.18–0.16 eV), ideal for efficient hydrogen adsorption and desorption. Bader charge analysis
reveals substantial electron accumulation at Zr and N sites, facilitating charge transfer and
improving catalytic performance. These findings establish Zr-doped MXenes as cost-effective,
high-performance alternatives to noble metal catalysts, offering a scalable pathway toward green
hydrogen production and next-generation electrocatalysts.'
