abstract: "Background
Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is an electrochemical process for achieving sustainable energy by
environment friendly process. To enhance the HER activity, perovskite BaTiO3 oxides are explored as
electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic solutions. The g-C3N4 is a
cost-effective, stable, and property tunable catalyst with electrocatalytic properties suitable for
HER. This study intends to utilize the advantages of both these by forming the BaTiO3/g-C3N4
composite, to enhance the electrocatalytic properties.
Method
The g-C3N4 and BaTiO3 were blended successfully through an annealing process. Various
characterization methods, like XRD, SEM, TEM, FTIR, UV, and Raman, confirms the formation of
BaTiO3/g-C3N4 composite. Electrochemical analysis for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)
demonstrated enhanced properties for the BaTiO3/g-C3N4 composite with different weight percentages.
Significant findings
BaTiO3 with 1 wt % g-C3N4 composite exhibit low overpotential value of 254 mV and Tafel slope with
205 mV/dec. The same sample exhibits enhanced performance in HER activity proving it to be worth
investigating more on these 2D incorporated perovskite materials for electrochemical hydrogen
evolution reaction. The observed enhanced electrocatalytic performance of the BaTiO3/g-C3N4
composite is attributed to the synergistic effects of BaTiO3 and g-C3N4 creating a new pathway for
the development of inexpensive and efficient electrocatalysts."
