          content: |
            Doping of 3d material changes the magnetic interaction $\mathsf{J_{ij}}$ considerably in Heusler alloy.
            The change in $\mathsf{J_{ij}}$ affects the Curie temperature of the materials,
            giving high magnetocaloric effect around room temperature.

        - title: Functionalize MXene for green hydrogen
          content: |
            $\mathsf{Ti_3C_2}$ MXene is a cheap material, easy to synthesize in production scale.
            We have shown that $\mathsf{Ti_3C_2}$ can be used as a catalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER)
            by means of doping Zr to Ti site.

        The **MAVENs** (Materials Advancing a Viable ENergy future) group, led by [Dr Rudra Banerjee](https://mavens-group.github.io/author/rudra-banerjee/), is based in the [Department of Physics and Nanotechnology](https://www.srmist.edu.in/department/department-of-physics-and-nanotechnology/) at [SRM Institute of Science and Technology](https://srmist.edu.in).
        We dream of a cleaner environment for future generations by developing innovative materials solutions for green energy through computational modelling.

        ### Mission & Approach

        We harness the power of Density Functional Theory (DFT), Monte Carlo simulations, and Machine Learning to uncover material properties from first principles. This powerful combination of quantum mechanics, statistical physics, and artificial intelligence enables us to predict, design, and optimise materials before they are synthesised in the laboratory.

        Through these cutting-edge computational methods, we design materials that will power tomorrowâ€™s sustainable technologies. Our interdisciplinary research bridges fundamental physics with practical applications, creating solutions for pressing energy challenges.

        The MAVENs team focuses on four transformative areas:
        - **Disordered alloys** for tuning functional properties
        - **Quantum materials** for quantum computing applications
        - **ML** aided material discovery

        {{% cta cta_link="./research/" cta_text="View Research Details" %}}

        We actively collaborate with leading experimentalists and theoreticians worldwide, fostering a synergistic environment that accelerates material discovery and enhances the reliability of our computational predictions.

        ### Join Our Team

        We invite talented MSc students with a passion for physics, chemistry, or materials science to join our dynamic research group.

        If you are excited about using computational tools to solve real-world problems and contribute to a sustainable future, we would love to hear from you.
