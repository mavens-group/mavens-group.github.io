          content: |
            Doping of 3d material changes the magnetic interaction $\mathsf{J_{ij}}$ considerably in Heusler alloy.
            The change in $\mathsf{J_{ij}}$ affects the Curie temperature of the materials,
            giving high magnetocaloric effect around room temperature.

        - title: Functionalize MXene for green hydrogen
          content: |
            $\mathsf{Ti_3C_2}$ MXene is a cheap material, easy to synthesize in production scale.
            We have shown that $\mathsf{Ti_3C_2}$ can be used as a catalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER)
            by means of doping Zr to Ti site.

        The **MAVENs** (*Materials Advancing a Viable ENergy future*) group, led by [Dr. Rudra Banerjee](https://mavens-group.github.io/author/rudra-banerjee/), is based in the [Department of Physics and Nanotechnology](https://www.srmist.edu.in/department/department-of-physics-and-nanotechnology/) at the [SRM Institute of Science and Technology](https://srmist.edu.in).

        We tackle the fundamental challenge of predicting material properties from electronic structure. Through computational modeling, we design materials with unprecedented capabilities like room-temperature quantum devices, efficient photocatalysts, and next-generation energy storage systems.

        ### Designing Tomorrow's Materials Today

        We harness **Density Functional Theory (DFT)**, **Monte Carlo simulations**, and **Machine Learning** — a powerful combination of quantum mechanics, statistical physics, and artificial intelligence that enables us to predict, design, and optimise materials before they are synthesised in the laboratory. From the magnetic complexity of high-entropy alloys to the catalytic potential green hydrogen and quantum materials with long coherence time, we bridge fundamental theory with transformative applications.

        Our breakthrough research spans three frontiers:

        - **Disordered alloys** – unlocking exceptional properties through strategic compositional design
        - **Quantum materials** – engineering the foundation for next-generation quantum technologies
        - **Machine learning** – accelerating discovery across vast material landscapes

        Every prediction we make connects with experimental reality. Through partnerships with leading experimentalists worldwide, we validate our models and push computational boundaries, ensuring our discoveries translate from silicon to laboratory bench.

        ### Join the Discovery

        We seek **M.Sc. students** in physics, chemistry, or materials science ready to wield computational power against real-world challenges. If you're passionate about designing materials that will define our sustainable future, your next breakthrough awaits here.
