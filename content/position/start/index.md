# Welcome to MAVENs — Start Your Journey Here

We're excited to have you explore a project with the [**MAVENs group**](http://mavens-group.github.io)! During your time here, you’ll become part of a team that’s passionate about advancing materials science for a sustainable energy future. This guide introduces our research philosophy, working style, essential tools, and some key readings. Each project is unique, but this will give you a solid foundation. I encourage you to explore the links, reflect on the ideas presented, and feel free to reach out to me with questions or suggestions.

## Research

### Our Mission

At MAVENs, we aim to address one of the most pressing challenges of our time — the quest for clean, sustainable energy. Today’s fossil-fuel-based systems pose serious concerns due to both resource depletion and pollution. Similarly, traditional cooling technologies contribute heavily to greenhouse gas emissions.

We believe in material-based solutions that can lead to real impact:

- **Hydrogen Evolution:** We explore materials for efficient water splitting, aiming to harness hydrogen as a clean energy source.
- **Magnetocalorics:** We study materials that use magnetic fields instead of pressure for cooling, offering a greener alternative to conventional systems.
- **Machine Learning:** We leverage computational methods and ML to accelerate discovery and optimize performance across our projects.

Our goal is to create technologies that are not just scientifically sound but also environmentally viable.

## How We Work

### Research Methodology

You’ll be working on cutting-edge, open-ended challenges — the kind where there isn’t always a clear path or existing solution. That’s the essence of research! You may not find the answers online — or even from me. Instead, focus on asking the right questions and exploring multiple paths.

Start simple. If you can’t find an answer, redefine the question. Research is iterative, creative, and deeply rewarding. For inspiration, watch Richard Hamming’s classic talk [*You and Your Research*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw) or read the [transcript](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html).

### What I Expect from You

Your project is a valuable contribution to our group’s broader research mission. Here’s what we look for in a team member:

1. **Deep Understanding**
   Learn your topic well enough to explain it clearly to others — that's a sign you truly understand it.

2. **Research Skills**
   Smart observations matter — but what matters even more is turning ideas into action. Ask questions, propose solutions, and iterate.

3. **Professionalism**
   Be honest, respectful, and collaborative. Share ideas and contribute to technical discussions. We value every voice.

4. **Clear Communication**
   Your work must reach the world. Learn to articulate your results in a way that resonates with both technical and general audiences.

If you're from another department, let me know so we can align with your departmental guidelines too.

## Tools and Workflow

We work with a range of open-source tools that empower you to collaborate and innovate efficiently.

### Linux

We use Linux as our primary OS — particularly the [Fedora distribution](https://fedoraproject.org/). You'll soon discover the freedom and flexibility it offers. While you can use the mouse for most things, for serious work, learning to use the terminal and `vim` is a must.

### Communication: Google Spaces

We communicate via [Google Chat Spaces](https://mail.google.com/chat/u/1/#chat/home). These spaces archive discussions so you can easily revisit ideas and help bring new team members up to speed.

### Git & GitHub

Version control is essential for research reproducibility. We use [Git](http://git-scm.com) and host our repositories on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/impact-group/). You’ll track all code and documents, including your thesis, using these tools.

### LaTeX

Your reports and presentations will be prepared using [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/), the standard for professional scientific writing. Get comfortable with it early — we’ll begin writing your final report soon after project kickoff.

### Zotero

You’ll receive access to our shared [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) library — a curated collection of key research papers that form the foundation of our work.

## Reporting Tips

Start early. Begin writing your final report in your **first month**, focusing on the **conclusions** first — a trick that often helps clarify your research path. For more on this, read [Magnusson’s essay on “Writing Backwards”](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4512522/Magnusson_1996-How_to_write_backwards.pdf).

Want to really sharpen your skills? Watch Simon Peyton Jones’s excellent lectures on [writing](http://sms.cam.ac.uk/media/1464870) and [giving talks](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/video/default.aspx?id=168648).

If you’re working on a Master's or PhD project, I expect a monthly update of your LaTeX report — building toward a publishable article.

## Your First Month — Getting Started Right

Here’s how to begin strong:

### Week 1 Checklist

- Email me the following commitment:

```text
<—BEGIN EMAIL TEXT—>

I hereby declare that, besides and on top of SRMIST’s standard codes of conduct and rules, I will:
– maintain confidentiality of all methods, data, results, and intellectual property.
– dedicate:
   – (For project students:) at least 10 hours/week before the final semester, and 40 hours/week during it.
   – (For PhD students:) at least 40 hours/week toward the project.
– adhere to all project timelines and milestones.

Failure to adhere to this commitment may result in the withdrawal of supervisory support by Dr. Banerjee.

– signed, [Your Name], [Date]

<—END EMAIL TEXT—>
```

- Your CV and transcript

- A recent photo (for our website or presentations)

- Your email and phone number

### Weeks 2–4 Goals
Write the first draft of your final report, focusing on conclusions. It can serve as both a proposal and a reference point.

Study our existing code on GitHub. You should understand enough to contribute confidently.

Begin practicing with Fortran/Python, Git, and GitHub. These tools may seem complex at first, but you’ll soon appreciate their power.

We'll also provide curated literature to help you dive into relevant concepts like AIMD, DFT, and Monte Carlo simulations.

## Let’s Begin

We’re excited to have you on board. This guide is a living document, so your feedback and suggestions are welcome. Let’s build something impactful together — welcome to the MAVENs family!
