By capitalizing on the advantages of both the DFT and the MC method, MAVENs accelerates and
improves material discovery through the application of machine learning (ML). Despite the provision
of precise electronic structure data by DFT, the prohibitive computational expense impedes
extensive material investigation. MC simulations are remarkable for examining large configuration
spaces, except from the limitation imposed by the configuration space's size. By incorporating ML
into this framework, a material discovery pipeline that is both robust and efficient is
established.

ML models acquire knowledge of the intricate correlations that exist among material structure,
composition, and properties via DFT calculations. This knowledge empowers them to forecast the
properties of unobserved materials with remarkable precision. Using this method, we can effectively
test the most theoretically promising materials found through the extensive MC simulations. This
lets us focus our next high-fidelity DFT and MC calculations on those materials.

Hence, by employing this integrated methodology, one can effectively and harmoniously traverse the
extensive domain of prospective materials while expediting the identification of materials
possessing specific functionalities.
