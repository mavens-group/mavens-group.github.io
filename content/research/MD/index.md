The MAVENs utilizes a potent fusion of Monte Carlo and Density Functional Theory (DFT)
techniques to advance the field of materials design. By employing this synergistic methodology, we
are able to conduct an in-depth analysis of the fundamental properties of matter, including the
atomic-level electronic structure, energies, and thermodynamics of substances.

We employ the accuracy of Density Functional Theory (DFT) to forecast the behaviour of materials
under various circumstances, whereas Monte Carlo (MC) simulations provide a statistical perspective
on the intricate interaction of variables in complex systems. By harnessing this capability, we
explore the domain of disorder effects and unveil labyrinthine pathways to materials possessing
customized functionalities.

By adopting this comprehensive strategy, we not only enhance our foundational comprehension of
materials but also create opportunities for advancements in various technologies. Our objective is
to manipulate the electronic and magnetic characteristics of materials by modifying them at the
atomic scale. This customization would specifically concentrate on functionalities such as caloric
effects, hydrogen evolution reactions, and qubit materials.
