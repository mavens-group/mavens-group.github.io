At MAVENs, we harness first-principles modeling, Monte Carlo simulations, and machine learning to unlock the properties of materials for next-generation technologies in energy, magnetism, and quantum applications.

### Our Research Philosophy

Our research is rooted in a fundamental question:

> ___How can we computationally design materials that power a sustainable and quantum-enabled future?___

We address this question by bridging fundamental theory with high-impact applications—ranging from the catalytic activity of doped MXenes and the quantum spin textures of disordered Heusler alloys to the classification of NV-defect host sites using machine learning. By uncovering structure–property relationships in complex materials, we harness tools such as density functional theory (DFT), the Monte Carlo method, and AI-driven discovery to guide the design of next-generation quantum and energy materials.

Explore our core research themes below to see how these ideas come to life in specific materials systems.
