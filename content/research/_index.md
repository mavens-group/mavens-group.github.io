At MAVENs, we harness **first-principles modeling, Monte Carlo simulations, and machine learning** to tackle key challenges in materials science, advancing the understanding and design of **next-generation materials** for energy, magnetism, and quantum applications.

### Our Research Philosophy

Our work is guided by a central question:

_**“How can we computationally design materials that solve pressing energy and quantum challenges?”**_

We address this by linking **atomic-scale structure to macroscopic properties**, bridging fundamental theory with real-world applications. From the catalytic activity of doped MXenes and quantum spin textures of disordered Heusler alloys to interpretable machine learning for defect-based qubit design, our focus is on **predictive insight rather than trial-and-error experimentation**.


### Computational Methods & Tools

We use a suite of computational approaches as **enablers to answer scientific questions**, including:

- **Density Functional Theory (DFT):** Predicts electronic, magnetic, and structural properties accurately
- **Monte Carlo Simulations:** Samples complex configurational spaces and thermodynamic behavior
- **Machine Learning:** Accelerates discovery with interpretable models for material property prediction
- **High-throughput Computing:** Systematic screening of candidate materials

These methods are applied **in service of our research themes**, ensuring that predictions are physically grounded and experimentally relevant.

### Collaborative Research

We actively collaborate with **experimental groups worldwide**, ensuring that computational predictions are **validated and translated into real-world applications**. These partnerships enhance the impact, credibility, and practical relevance of our work.

### Research Impact

Our computational insights drive materials innovation by:

- Reducing experimental trial-and-error
- Predicting novel materials prior to synthesis
- Revealing fundamental mechanisms behind complex behaviour
- Accelerating the translation of discovery into functional technologies

Our work contributes directly to global efforts in **clean energy, quantum technologies, and advanced manufacturing**.

### Research Themes

Our research spans **three interconnected themes**, each addressing a specific scientific challenge. Click each title to explore the detailed subpages.
