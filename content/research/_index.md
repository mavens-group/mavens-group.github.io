At MAVENs, we harness first-principles modeling, Monte Carlo simulations, and machine learning to unlock the properties of materials for next-generation technologies in energy, magnetism, and quantum applications.

### Our Research Philosophy

Our research is rooted in a fundamental question:

___How can we computationally design materials that power a sustainable and quantum-enabled future?___

From the quantum spin textures of disordered Heusler alloys to the catalytic activity of doped MXenes, our work bridges fundamental theory with high-impact applications. We explore the structure-property relationships of complex systems using tools from density functional theory (DFT), statistical mechanics, and AI-driven discovery.
