### Scientific Challenge
Discovering functional materials with targeted properties is critical for technological advancement, but the **vast chemical composition space** and complex structure-property relationships make this task extremely challenging.

Traditional approaches, including **trial-and-error experiments** and high-throughput ab initio calculations, are time-consuming and resource-intensive, **limiting exploration** and slowing the pace of discovery. Developing methods that efficiently predict material properties while providing scientific insight is therefore a key challenge.

### Our Approach
We leverage **Machine Learning (ML)** to accelerate materials discovery through **data-driven, physics-informed models**:

- Identify patterns and correlations in chemical and structural datasets to predict material properties rapidly
- Reduce computational cost and exploration time compared to conventional methods
- Develop **hybrid ML approaches** that combine predictive power with **physical interpretability**, mapping feature vectors to meaningful descriptors

This approach ensures that our models not only make accurate predictions but also generate **actionable scientific insights**, bridging computational efficiency with fundamental understanding. We explicitly prioritise physical interpretability over marginal gains in predictive accuracy, ensuring that machine-learning models serve as tools for scientific understanding rather than black-box optimisers detached from materials physics.

### Key Insights & Achievements
- Designed ML models targeting materials for **quantum information processing**, specifically defects analogous to nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond
- Achieved **F1 scores > 0.98** and **Matthews correlation coefficients > 0.90** on imbalanced datasets while maintaining model interpretability
- Predicted materials suitable for building **qubit arrays with long coherence times at room temperature**, providing a roadmap for experimental validation

These results demonstrate that interpretable ML can **accelerate the discovery of quantum-relevant materials**, enabling the design of defect-based qubits and other advanced functional systems. These models are designed to identify physically plausible candidates and governing descriptors, not to replace first-principles validation or experimental verification.
