### The Challenge:
Traditional materials design relies on ordered crystal structures, but what if disorder is actually beneficial?

Disordered systems stand apart due to their lack of long-range atomic order, which often enhances their mechanical, magnetic, and electronic properties. In high-entropy alloys (HEAs), a multi-component, near-equimolar composition creates high configurational entropy, resulting in properties like exceptional strength, corrosion resistance, and thermal stability. This configurational randomness also allows disordered systems to bypass traditional alloying limitations, enabling fine-tuning of properties via compositional adjustments and doping.
This power comes with the computational challenge that, since the basis set is no longer periodic, Bloch's theorem—one of the cornerstones of computational materials science—is no longer valid. Such tunability has found applications in energy-efficient technologies, including hydrogen evolution reactions and magnetocaloric refrigeration, and advanced devices like spintronic components.
### Our Approach:
At MAVENs, we focus on advancing the understanding and application of disordered systems, including Heusler alloys (X₂YZ) and MXenes (MₙXₙ₋₁) for green energy and advanced technologies. We utilize density functional theory (DFT) with plane-wave based supercell methods and Green's function based CPA methods to investigate doping strategies that tune electronic and magnetic properties.

### Recent Achievements:
Our computational predictions have led to significant breakthroughs, including the development of Ni-Mn-based shape memory alloys with extended operating temperature ranges and enhanced magnetocaloric effects in Fe-Cr-V-based systems. Our work on Mn₂CoAl highlights the group's proficiency in using computational methods to provide critical insights for experimentalists. By investigating site-selective doping and its effects on properties like Tᶜ and SGS behaviour, we pave the way for designing next-generation materials tailored for specific applications.
For MXenes, our research has demonstrated excellent catalytic properties for hydrogen evolution reactions. Our work has shown that Zr-doped Ti₃C₂ and Ti₃CN exhibit superior catalytic performance with |ΔGₕ| ≈ 0.1 eV, significantly improving upon the properties of pure Ti₃C₂.
