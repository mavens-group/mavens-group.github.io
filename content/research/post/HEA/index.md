### Scientific Challenge

High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are multi-component, near-equimolar systems in which **configurational disorder plays a constructive role**, enabling exceptional mechanical strength, corrosion resistance, magnetic functionality, and thermal stability. This intrinsic disorder also provides a powerful design handle: targeted compositional tuning and doping can systematically modify macroscopic properties.

However, **predictive design in disordered alloys remains fundamentally challenging**. The absence of translational symmetry renders Bloch’s theorem inapplicable, limiting conventional band-structure approaches. A central scientific challenge is therefore to understand **how atomic-scale disorder, site occupancy, and compositional fluctuations govern emergent electronic, magnetic, and thermodynamic behaviour**. Resolving this problem is critical both for fundamental materials physics and for applications in **energy-efficient technologies**, including hydrogen evolution catalysis, magnetocaloric refrigeration, and spintronic devices.

### Our Approach

We adopt a **methodologically controlled, physics-led framework** to study disorder in complex alloys:

- **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** with plane-wave supercell models to represent realistic atomic configurations
- **Green’s-function-based Coherent Potential Approximation (CPA)** to capture substitutional disorder beyond finite supercells
- **Compositional tuning and site-selective doping strategies** to isolate the role of specific atomic substitutions
- **Mean-field and Monte Carlo methods** to connect electronic structure with finite-temperature thermodynamic behaviour

Rather than attempting exhaustive configurational sampling or universal optimisation, we focus on **robust compositional trends and disorder-tolerant mechanisms** that remain meaningful across configurational variability. This approach enables **predictive, experimentally relevant insight** while respecting the intrinsic limits imposed by disorder.

### Key Insights & Achievements

- Identified **Ni–Mn-based shape-memory alloys** with extended operational temperature windows
- Demonstrated **enhanced magnetocaloric responses** in Fe–Cr–V-based disordered systems
- Revealed **site-selective doping mechanisms** in Mn₂CoAl that govern Curie temperature (Tc) and spin-gapless semiconductor (SGS) behaviour, directly relevant for spintronic applications
- Identified **spin-glass behaviour in near-equiatomic FeRh**, clarifying the role of competing magnetic interactions in chemically disordered environments

Collectively, these results establish a **mechanism-driven roadmap for the rational design of disordered alloys**, where functional properties emerge from controlled compositional complexity rather than idealised order.
