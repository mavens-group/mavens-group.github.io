### Scientific Challenge
Disordered alloys—including high-entropy alloys (HEAs) and compositionally complex Heusler systems—are multi-component materials in which **chemical disorder plays a constructive role**, enabling exceptional mechanical strength, corrosion resistance, magnetic functionality, and thermal stability. This intrinsic disorder also provides a powerful design handle: targeted compositional tuning and doping can systematically modify macroscopic properties.

However, **predictive design in disordered alloys remains fundamentally challenging**. The absence of translational symmetry renders Bloch’s theorem inapplicable, limiting conventional band-structure approaches. A central scientific challenge is therefore to understand **how atomic-scale disorder, site occupancy, and compositional fluctuations govern emergent electronic, magnetic, and thermodynamic behaviour**. Resolving this problem is critical both for fundamental materials physics and for applications in **energy-efficient technologies**, including hydrogen evolution catalysis, magnetocaloric refrigeration, and spintronic devices.

### Our Approach
We adopt a **methodologically controlled, physics-led framework** to study disorder in complex alloys, implementing **high-throughput computing** to map concentration-dependent properties systematically:

- **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** with plane-wave supercell models to represent realistic atomic configurations
- **Green’s-function-based Coherent Potential Approximation (CPA)** to capture substitutional disorder beyond finite supercells
- **Compositional tuning and site-selective doping strategies** to isolate the role of specific atomic substitutions
- **Mean-field and Monte Carlo methods** to connect electronic structure with finite-temperature thermodynamic behaviour

Rather than attempting exhaustive configurational sampling or universal optimisation, we focus on **robust compositional trends and disorder-tolerant mechanisms** that remain meaningful across configurational variability. This approach enables **predictive, experimentally relevant insight** while respecting the intrinsic limits imposed by disorder.

### Key Insights & Achievements
- Identified **multi-ion disorder effects in Zn-K/WO₃ electrochromic systems** via DFT, supporting experimental battery development (50% modulation, 3000 cycles) with [AKS group](https://sites.google.com/view/ashutoshksingh-cens/)
- Identified **Ni–Mn-based Heusler alloy** with extended operational temperature windows
- Revealed **site-selective doping mechanisms** in Mn₂CoAl that govern Curie temperature (Tc) and spin-gapless semiconductor (SGS) behaviour, directly relevant for spintronic applications
- Identified **spin-glass behaviour in near-equiatomic FeRh**, clarifying the role of competing magnetic interactions in chemically disordered environments

Collectively, these results establish a **mechanism-driven roadmap for the rational design of disordered alloys**, where functional properties emerge from controlled compositional complexity rather than idealised order.
