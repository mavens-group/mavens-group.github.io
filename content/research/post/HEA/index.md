### Scientific Challenge
High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are multi-component, near-equimolar alloys where **configurational disorder enhances mechanical, magnetic, and electronic properties**. This randomness allows fine-tuning of strength, corrosion resistance, and thermal stability via compositional adjustments or doping.

However, **predicting which compositions yield optimal properties is challenging** because disordered systems lack periodicity, invalidating Bloch’s theorem. Understanding how atomic-scale disorder affects macroscopic performance is therefore a **central scientific question** for both fundamental materials science and applications in energy-efficient technologies such as **hydrogen evolution reactions, magnetocaloric refrigeration, and spintronic devices**.

### Our Approach
To address this challenge, we combine **first-principles theory with advanced computational techniques**:

- **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** with plane-wave supercells to model realistic atomic configurations
- **Coherent Potential Approximation (CPA)** based Green’s function methods to capture disorder effects
- **Compositional tuning and doping strategies** to investigate how specific substitutions modify electronic, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties

This framework allows us to **link atomic-level disorder with targeted material functionality**, providing predictive insights for experimental design.

### Key Insights & Achievements
- Identified **Ni-Mn-based shape memory alloys** with extended operating temperature ranges
- Demonstrated **enhanced magnetocaloric effects** in Fe-Cr-V-based systems
- Explored **site-selective doping** in Mn₂CoAl, uncovering mechanisms controlling Curie temperature (Tc) and spin-glass (SGS) behavior for spintronic applications
- For MXenes, showed that **Zr-doped Ti₃C₂ and Ti₃CN** outperform pure Ti₃C₂ in hydrogen evolution reactions, achieving |ΔGₕ| ≈ 0.1 eV

> These results provide a predictive roadmap for designing disordered alloys and 2D materials with **tailored functional properties** for green energy and advanced technologies.
