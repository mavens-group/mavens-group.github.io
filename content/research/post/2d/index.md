At MAVENs, we address the challenges of leveraging single magnetic molecules, such as organometallic molecules, and other 2D materials for applications in molecular magnets and qubits. These systems exhibit tunable electronic states and intrinsic magnetic properties, making them promising candidates for quantum information processing and spintronic devices. However, their practical integration is hindered by challenges like spin decoherence, instability of spin-polarised states, and inefficient charge transport.

To tackle these issues, our group uses Density Functional Theory (DFT) to study the effects of doping and substrate interactions. We focus on how substrates like graphene and BN enhance electronic coupling, stabilise reactive states, and improve spin coherence, enabling these molecules to function effectively as qubits and molecular magnets.

For example, our research shows that metalloporphyrins stacked on graphene substrates demonstrate enhanced spin transmission and stability, paving the way for their use in quantum sensors and molecular spintronic devices. This approach highlights the potential of molecular systems and 2D materials for next-generation quantum technologies.
