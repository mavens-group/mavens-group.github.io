### Scientific Challenge
Single magnetic molecules, such as organometallic systems, and 2D materials hold promise as **molecular magnets and qubits** for quantum information processing and spintronic devices. Their tunable electronic states and intrinsic magnetic properties make them candidates for **quantum computing architectures, magnetic sensors, data storage devices, and quantum communication networks**.

However, practical integration faces significant challenges, including **spin decoherence, instability of spin-polarized states, and inefficient charge transport**. Addressing these challenges is central to realizing functional quantum devices.

### Our Approach
We use **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** to investigate how **doping and substrate interactions** influence the electronic and magnetic properties of molecular systems and 2D materials.

Key aspects of our approach include:
- Studying substrates like **graphene and boron nitride (BN)** to enhance electronic coupling and stabilize reactive states
- Optimizing molecular systems to **improve spin coherence and transmission**
- Linking atomic-scale modifications to device-relevant performance metrics

This strategy enables us to **predictively design 2D/molecular hybrid systems** with enhanced stability and functionality for quantum technologies.
