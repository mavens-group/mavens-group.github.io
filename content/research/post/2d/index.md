### Scientific Challenge
Two-dimensional (2D) materials provide a powerful platform for engineering **electronic and spin-dependent phenomena at reduced dimensionality**, making them attractive for applications in **quantum technologies, spintronics, sensing, and energy conversion**. Their properties are highly tunable through **defects, dopants, strain, and interfacial coupling**, offering opportunities to design materials with targeted functionality.

However, realizing functional devices based on 2D systems remains challenging. Key limitations include **spin decoherence, instability of spin-polarized states, inefficient charge transport, and poor interfacial control**. Understanding how atomic-scale modifications and hybrid interfaces govern these effects is essential for translating 2D materials from idealized models to realistic device architectures.

### Our Approach
We focus on **2D materials (MXenes), monolayers (transition metal dichalcogenides) and single magnetic molecules (porphyrins)**, where controlled perturbations enable predictive tuning of electronic, magnetic, and catalytic properties.

Our approach combines **DFT** and **MC** with systematic materials design strategies to:
- Investigate how **dopants, defects, and adsorbates** modify electronic structure and spin polarization
- Study **interfacial coupling** between 2D materials and molecular or metallic species to enhance spin transmission and stability
- Link atomic-scale modifications to **device-relevant performance metrics**, including spin coherence, charge transport, and catalytic activity

Within this framework, **spintronic, quantum, and catalytic functionalities are treated as complementary outcomes of electronic structure control in selected 2D material systems**.

### Key Insights & Achievements
- Explained experimental electrochromic battery performance through DFT calculations, **identifying Jahn-Teller distortion in WO₃·H₂O as the structural origin** of enhanced optical modulation and capacity in collaboration with [AKS group](https://sites.google.com/view/ashutoshksingh-cens/)
- Demonstrated that **2D organometallic molecules**, such as metalloporphyrins, significantly enhance spin transmission and optical properties
- Established design principles for **TMDCs**, addressing key challenges related to coherence and stability
- For MXenes, showed that **Zr-doped Ti₃C₂ and Ti₃CN** exhibit superior catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reactions, achieving |ΔGₕ| ≈ 0.1 eV and outperforming pristine Ti₃C₂
- Revealed how controlled chemical modifications in 2D systems can simultaneously optimize **electronic, magnetic, and catalytic responses**

Collectively, these results establish a **mechanism-driven framework for engineering 2D materials**, where spintronic, quantum, and catalytic functionalities emerge from controlled atomic-scale modifications rather than trial-and-error synthesis.
