## Why CView?

In computational materials science, visualizing large supercells or complex lattice structures often requires heavy GUI-based software that breaks the terminal-based workflow.

**cview** bridges this gap. It is built to be lightweight, fast, and integrable directly into your command-line environment, allowing you to inspect structures without leaving your terminal.

## Key Capabilities

* **High-Fidelity Rendering**: Optimized for clarity, even with dense atomic structures.
* **Workflow Integration**: works alongside standard tools (like VASP, Quantum ESPRESSO) to visualize outputs instantly.
* **Lightweight Footprint**: No heavy GUI overhead; designed for speed and efficiency on clusters and local machines.

## Quick Start

Get up and running in seconds. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/mavensgroup/cview.git](https://github.com/mavensgroup/cview.git)
cd cview
# Install command (verify specific instructions in README)
```
