- {{<hl>}}Statistical concepts{{</hl>}} and how to apply them in practice

## Program overview
DFT is an indispensable tool in computational physics and Materials science.
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Density Functional Theory (DFT), a quantum
mechanical method widely used in physics, chemistry, and materials science for investigating the
electronic structure of many-body systems, particularly atoms, molecules, and solids. The course
aims to equip participants with the theoretical foundation and practical skills necessary to
perform DFT calculations and analyze their results.
