The Kohn--Sham formalism provides a practical framework for implementing Density Functional Theory (DFT) by introducing a fictitious system of non-interacting electrons that yields the same ground-state electron density as the true interacting system.

### Motivation

While the Hohenberg--Kohn theorems establish the existence of a universal energy functional $F[\rho]$, they do not provide an explicit form for it. The Kohn--Sham approach circumvents this issue by splitting the functional into known and unknown parts, allowing the ground-state properties to be determined via self-consistent single-particle equations.

### Decomposition of the Energy Functional

The total energy functional is written as:
\begin{equation}
    E[\rho] = T_s[\rho] + E_{\mathrm{H}}[\rho] + E_{\mathrm{xc}}[\rho] + \int V_{\mathrm{ext}}(\mathbf{r}) \rho(\mathbf{r}) \, d\mathbf{r},
\end{equation}
where:
* $T_s[\rho]$ is the kinetic energy of a system of non-interacting electrons with density $\rho(\mathbf{r})$.
* $E_{\mathrm{H}}[\rho]$ is the classical electrostatic (Hartree) energy:
    \begin{equation}
        E_{\mathrm{H}}[\rho] = \frac{1}{2} \int \int \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}) \rho(\mathbf{r'})}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r'}|} \, d\mathbf{r} \, d\mathbf{r'}.
    \end{equation}

* $E_{\mathrm{xc}}[\rho]$ is the exchange-correlation energy functional, which includes all many-body effects: exchange, correlation, and the difference between the true kinetic energy and $T_s[\rho]$.

### The Kohn--Sham Ansatz

Assume that the ground-state density $\rho(\mathbf{r})$ can be represented by a set of single-particle orbitals $\{ \phi_i(\mathbf{r}) \}$ such that:
\begin{equation}
    \rho(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} |\phi_i(\mathbf{r})|^2,
\end{equation}
where the orbitals $\phi_i$ are solutions of a fictitious system of non-interacting particles.

#### Derivation of the Kohn--Sham Equations

To find the orbitals that minimize the energy functional under the constraint of orthonormality,
\begin{equation}
    \langle \phi_i | \phi_j \rangle = \delta_{ij},
\end{equation}
we perform a constrained minimization using Lagrange multipliers. The functional to minimize is:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L} = E[\rho] - \sum_{i,j} \lambda_{ij} \left( \langle \phi_i | \phi_j \rangle - \delta_{ij} \right).
\end{equation}

Taking functional derivatives with respect to $\phi_i^*(\mathbf{r})$ leads to the Eulerâ€“Lagrange equations:
\begin{equation}
    \left[ -\frac{1}{2} \nabla^2 + V_{\mathrm{eff}}(\mathbf{r}) \right] \phi_i(\mathbf{r}) = \epsilon_i \phi_i(\mathbf{r}),
\end{equation}
where the effective potential $V_{\mathrm{eff}}(\mathbf{r})$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
    V_{\mathrm{eff}}(\mathbf{r}) = V_{\mathrm{ext}}(\mathbf{r}) + V_{\mathrm{H}}(\mathbf{r}) + V_{\mathrm{xc}}(\mathbf{r}).
\end{equation}

Here,
* $V_{\mathrm{H}}(\mathbf{r}) = \int \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r'})}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r'}|} \, d\mathbf{r'}$ is the Hartree potential,
* $V_{\mathrm{xc}}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\delta E_{\mathrm{xc}}[\rho]}{\delta \rho(\mathbf{r})}$ is the exchange-correlation potential.

### Self-Consistent Solution Procedure

The Kohn--Sham equations are solved self-consistently using the following iterative loop:
1. Start with an initial guess for the electron density $\rho^{(0)}(\mathbf{r})$.
1. Construct the effective potential $V_{\mathrm{eff}}^{(n)}(\mathbf{r})$.
1. Solve the Kohn--Sham equations to obtain the orbitals $\phi_i^{(n)}(\mathbf{r})$.
1. Compute the new density:
    \begin{equation}
        \rho^{(n+1)}(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{i=1}^N |\phi_i^{(n)}(\mathbf{r})|^2.
    \end{equation}
1. Check for convergence. If not converged, return to step 2.

### Remarks

* The Kohn--Sham approach allows the use of efficient single-particle methods to capture the ground-state properties of an interacting system.
* All complexities of exchange and correlation are absorbed into $E_{\mathrm{xc}}[\rho]$, which must be approximated (e.g., using LDA, GGA, etc.).
* The eigenvalues $\epsilon_i$ do not have rigorous physical interpretation except for the highest occupied orbital, which (under some assumptions) equals the negative of the ionization energy.
